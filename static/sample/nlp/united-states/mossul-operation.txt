A recent report showing that US-led forces have killed almost 200 civilians in Syria and Iraq since its anti-Islamic State operations began indicates the offensive in Mosul will likely be a lengthy affair, former Pentagon official Michael Maloof told RT.

RT: We’ve seen a lot of claims coming from all sides alleging collateral damage from these operations. Is so-called collateral damage just an inescapable part of war now?
Michael Maloof: Well, yes. It is unfortunate but it is the reality. On both sides, as you pointed out. But the US is supposed to double-check and triple-check and make sure that there is no such thing as civilians in harm’s way. But given the reality on the ground there, it is the case. The problem that I am seeing is that when they talk about “not credible sources,” it basically means they don’t have enough information to determine whether or not there was actual collateral damage of civilians being killed. That really means we don’t have intelligence on the ground. We shouldn’t be bombing in areas where we lack good intelligence on the ground. And that has been one of the major problems, and especially since the rebels, for some time now, have integrated themselves in with the local population to shield themselves. And that is the reality of war, especially in an urban environment.
